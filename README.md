# codebot

Official codebot source code for codedamn's discord server: http://bit.ly/codedamn-discord-group
It is limited in functionality for now but soon will be responsible for a bunch of things - from moderation to roles management and chatting with people. CodeBot analyses your Discord server and send you a daily resume about what happened on your server. It precises the most active members, channels, peak hours etc. All theses data are presented as graphics to get a better comprehension of data. It can also help you to moderate your server because the bot saves all the messages and the relevant informations, so you can let the bot does its job. 

PS : Open for contribution.

Improve this README.md - can be your first PR here :)
